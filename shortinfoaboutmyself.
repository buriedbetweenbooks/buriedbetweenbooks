- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @buriedbetweenbooks, call me Casper.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in books, movies, animes and mostly music.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things such as myself and expanding my vocabulary.
- âœ’ Iâ€™m looking for people where I could share my passion with and having friends to interact with.
- ðŸ“« My facebook name's Casper. It's linked in my profile, just check it out.

I usually am quiet and I tend to get shy a lot. I suggest if you don't have patience, I'm not the ond you should talk to. 
I'm still working on with my skills in writing since it's been a yesr that last time I posted one. This time, I'd want to create 
something that I'll be happy doing it and not just fod the public. 

If you want some help, message me okay? I'd love to hangout.
